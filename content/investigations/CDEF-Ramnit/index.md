### <span class="hl">TL;DR</span>
A Windows memory image was provided for analysis. Process enumeration revealed a suspicious `ChromeSetup.exe` process spawned under `explorer.exe`, indicating direct user-context execution rather than a legitimate installer flow. Network scan output showed `ChromeSetup.exe` initiating an outbound connection to `58.64.204.181:5202` in Hong Kong. The process was dumped from memory and submitted to VirusTotal, where it was flagged by **68/72 vendors** as **Ramnit** - a worm and credential-stealing trojan.

### <span style="color:red">Process Analysis</span>
I started by running `windows.pslist` against the memory image using Volatility 3.

![Process list](pslist.png)

The process list showed **ChromeSetup.exe** (PID 4628) as a child of **explorer.exe** (PID 4568).

### <span style="color:red">Network Analysis</span>

With a suspicious process identified, I ran `windows.netscan` to enumerate active and recently closed network connections and correlate them with running processes

![Network connections](netstat.png)

**ChromeSetup.exe** had an active outbound connection in state SYN_SENT to `58.64.204.181:5202` at **19:48:51 UTC** - one second after the process started. SYN_SENT means the TCP handshake was initiated but not yet completed at the moment of memory capture, indicating the malware was actively attempting to reach its C2 server. Port **5202** is non-standard and has no legitimate association with Chrome.

I checked the destination IP - `58.64.204.181` resolves to **NWT IDC Data Service, Hong Kong**. There is no legitimate reason for a Chrome installer to connect to a Hong Kong data center IP on a non-standard port.

### <span style="color:red">File Extraction and Identification</span>
With the process confirmed as suspicious through both process tree anomalies and network behavior, I dumped the executable from memory using `windows.dumpfiles` targeting PID 4628

The dumped file `file.0xca82b85325a0.0xca82b7e06c80.ImageSectionObject.ChromeSetup.exe.img` was submitted to **VirusTotal** by MD5 hash `11318cc3a3613fb679e25973a0a701fc`.

![VirusTotal](file_virustotal.png)

**68 out of 72** vendors flagged the file as malicious. The popular threat label is `virus.nimnul/vjadtre`, with family labels including **nimnul**, **vjadtre**, and **wapomi**. Threat categories are listed as virus and trojan. VirusTotal behavior tags include persistence, spreader, checks-network-adapters, and detect-debug-environmen` - consistent with Ramnit's known behavior of infecting executables on the local filesystem, spreading via removable drives, and establishing persistent C2 communication.
