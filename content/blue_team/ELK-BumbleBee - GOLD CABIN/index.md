### <span class="hl">TL;DR</span>

A phishing email delivered through the anonymous mail relay emkei.cz (114.29.236.247) reached CompliantSecure's mail server MAIL01 at **2024-12-01 20:38:14**. Twenty-three minutes later, user Administrator on IT01 downloaded `NovaSecure_Audit_Findings.iso` via Chrome webmail. After extracting the ISO with 7-Zip, the user executed Compliance_Reports.lnk, which launched **BumbleBee** loader `23.dll` via rundll32.exe, establishing C2 to 3.68.97.124:443. The loader injected into ImagingDevices.exe at **21:09:27** (T1055), which beaconed a second C2 at 18.193.157.255:443. LSASS was dumped via procdump64.exe into C:\ProgramData\doc1.dmp. At **22:03**, the attacker laterally moved to DC01 via PsExec using cracked markw credentials, dropped 1.7z containing **AdFind** and **AnyDesk**, created backdoor account sql_admin, performed network reconnaissance with a bat script, and RDP'd to FileServer01 (10.10.11.18). The attacker collected and archived share data, moved to Support01 using markw, downloaded Accounts_Updates_1524.csv, and finally executed `patch.exe` (Conti ransomware) across DC01 and FileServer01, dropping `R3ADM3.txt` ransom notes across all share directories.

### <span style="color:red">Initial Access</span>

#### Phishing Email

To identify the initial access vector I started by examining mail server logs on MAIL01.

![Postfix log - emkei.cz connection](smtp.png)

At **20:38:14**, the log recorded *Anonymous TLS connection established from emkei.cz[114.29.236.247]* - emkei.cz is a anonymous email relay service frequently abused for phishing campaigns. I checked the domain on VirusTotal, where 12 out of 94 vendors flagged it as **Malicious/Phishing**.

![emkei.cz VirusTotal result](emkei_virus.png)

#### ISO Delivery via Webmail

23 minutes after the phishing email arrived, I found a Sysmon Event ID 15 on host IT01 at **21:02:00**.

![Event ID 15 - ISO download](15.png)

User Administrator downloaded `NovaSecure_Audit_Findings.iso` (SHA256: F445F806066028D621D8E6A6B949E59342C309DFEB1D517BD847F70069B1B8DD) through chrome.exe from the internal webmail. At **21:02:17**, the user extracted the ISO using 7-Zip, which unpacked three files into C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\NovaSecure_Audit_Findings\: `23.dll`, `Compliance_Reports.lnk`, and `Critical_Findings_Summary.pdf`.

![7-Zip extraction - ISO contents](extracted_files.png)

### <span style="color:red">Execution</span>

#### BumbleBee Loader

At **21:02:57** the Administrator double-clicked `Compliance_Reports.lnk`, which executed:

```
"C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe" 23.dll, StartW
```

![LNK execution - rundll32 launching 23.dll](first_access.png)

This is the **BumbleBee** loader execution pattern - delivering a DLL inside an ISO and triggering it via an LNK file is the signature initial access technique associated with the **GOLD CABIN** threat group. The `StartW` export is BumbleBee's standard entry point. Immediately at the same timestamp, Sysmon Event ID 3 confirmed rundll32.exe established an outbound TCP connection to **3.68.97.124:443**.

![C2 connection to 3.68.97.124](3.png)

#### Post-Exploitation Discovery

Starting at **21:10:27**, rundll32.exe spawned cmd.exe child processes for host and network enumeration.

### <span style="color:red">Process Injection and C2 Persistence</span>

#### Injection into ImagingDevices.exe

At **21:06:02**, rundll32.exe (PID 4764) created `C:\Program Files\Windows Photo Viewer\ImagingDevices.exe` - a legitimate signed Windows binary selected to blend into normal process activity.
![ImagingDevices.exe spawned by rundll32](imaging.png)

At **21:09:27**, Sysmon event id 8 confirmed code injection from rundll32.exe (PID 4764) into `ImagingDevices.exe`.
![CreateRemoteThread into ImagingDevices.exe](inj.png)

The injected process subsequently established a second outbound HTTPS connection, from `ImagingDevices.exe` on IT01 to 18.193.157.255:443 - a second C2.

![ImagingDevices.exe C2 to 18.193.157.255](c2.png)

### <span style="color:red">Credential Dumping</span>

At **21:15:03**, cmd.exe executed:

```
procdump64.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe C:\ProgramData\doc1.dmp
```

![LSASS dump via procdump64](dump.png)

**ProcDump** is a legitimate Sysinternals diagnostic utility abused here to create a full memory dump of lsass.exe. The output file `doc1.dmp` was named to appear as a generic document. At **21:16:06**, `ImagingDevices.exe` dropped C:\ProgramData\7zr.exe to the disk in preparation for compressing and staging the dump for exfiltration.

![7zr.exe dropped by ImagingDevices.exe](7zr.png)

### <span style="color:red">Lateral Movement</span>

#### Initial Access to DC01

With credentials obtained from the LSASS dump, the attacker authenticated to DC01 at **22:03**.

![markw elevated logon to DC01](dc01.png)

#### PsExec Deployment

At **22:03:41** on DC01, the file `C:\Windows\0453497.exe` was created, followed immediately at **22:04:02** by registry entries under `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\0453497\` registering it as a Windows service, looks like **PsExec** lateral movement pattern where the tool copies a service binary to `ADMIN$` and registers it remotely.
![0453497.exe service registration](043.png)

At **22:04:03**,rundll32.exe was launched as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM with parent `\\10.10.11.156\ADMIN$\0453497.exe`, confirming PsExec execution originating from host 10.10.11.156.

![rundll32.exe as SYSTEM via PsExec](q.png)

### <span style="color:red">Post-Exploitation on DC01</span>

#### Tool Staging

At **22:06:58** and **22:07:10**, `C:\ProgramData\1.7z` and `C:\ProgramData\7zr.exe` were created. The attcker extracted the archive, producing `C:\ProgramData\AdFind.exe` and `C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk.exe`. **AdFind** is a command-line Active Directory query tool used for domain reconnaissance. **AnyDesk** is a remote access application deployed here as a persistent backdoor channel independent of the compromised C2 implant.

![1.7z and 7zr.exe drop](post1.png)

![AdFind and AnyDesk extraction](post1_5.png)

#### Backdoor Account Creation

At **22:07:44** the attacker created a new local user and immediately elevated it:

```
cmd.exe /C net user sql_admin P@ssw0rd! /add
cmd.exe /C net localgroup Administrators sql_admin /ADD
```

![sql_admin account creation](post2.png)

#### Network Reconnaissance

At **22:27:01**, `computers.txt` and `1.bat` were created on the sql_admin Desktop. At **22:27:11**, `1.bat` was executed, pinging four domain hosts by name: IT01.ad.compliantsecure.store, DC01.ad.compliantsecure.store, Support01.ad.compliantsecure.store, and FileServer01.ad.compliantsecure.store - confirming all four were reachable for further lateral movement.

![Network reconnaissance bat script](rec2.png)

#### RDP to FileServer01

At **22:30:17**, C:\Users\sql_admin\Documents\Default.rdp was created, signaling RDP session preparation. At **22:30:26 - 22:31:32**, Sysmon **Event ID 3** confirmed `mstsc.exe` connecting from 10.10.11.156 to 10.10.11.18 on port 3389 under sql_admin.

![Default.rdp creation](rdp.png)

![mstsc.exe RDP lateral movement](rdp1.png)

### <span style="color:red">Collection and Exfiltration</span>

At **22:36** and **22:51** on the file server, PowerShell accessed files across `C:\Users\sql_admin\Desktop\Shares\` and its subdirectories Documents, Finance, Taxes, and HR. The presence of `R3ADM3.txt` in every directory indicated ransomware note deployment had already begun during collection.
![File collection and ransom notes on FileServer01](exf.png)

The attacker archived the collected share data into `Shares.7z` and exfiltrated it.

### <span style="color:red">Ransomware Deployment</span>

At **22:41:21**, `patch.exe` was created in `C:\Shares\` on FileServer01. At **22:50:02**, `patch.exe` was executed locally. And at **22:50:55**, it was launched on DC01 via the network share path `\\10.10.11.18\Shares\patch.exe`.

![patch.exe drop and timestomping on FileServer01](pat1.png)

At **22:50:57**, mass creation of `R3ADM3.txt` across `C:\Users\Public\`, `C:\Users\Default\AppData\`, and other directories confirmed `patch.exe` as **Conti ransomware** - the ransom note naming convention `R3ADM3.txt` is a known Conti indicator.
