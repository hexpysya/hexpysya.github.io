### <span style="color:red">Identification</span>

#### <span class="hl">Is the payload malicious?</span>

I submitted the hash to VirusTotal - 38/65 vendors flagged the file as malicious. Popular threat label is `trojan.sagent/vpnz`, threat categories trojan and downloader.
SHA256: 08d4fd5032b8b24072bdff43932630d4200f68404d7e12ffeeda2364c8158873

VT Code Insights identified an `\AutoOpen` macro in the NewMacros.bas module that uses the Shell function to execute a *PowerShell* command downloading a file from a remote URL and invoking it - execution without any user interaction beyond opening the document.

#### <span class="hl">Did anyone request the C2?</span>

No. The file was blocked on download - it never reached the filesystem and no outbound C2 connections were observed from `172.16.17.37`.

#### <span class="hl">Did the attack succeed?</span>

No. The device action was `Blocked` - the file was quarantined before execution.

### <span style="color:red">Triage Decision</span>

**True Positive.** A confirmed malicious DOCM with an AutoOpen PowerShell downloader macro was blocked at download. No execution, no C2 contact, no escalation required.

#### <span class="hl">What is the impact level?</span>

Low. The file was blocked before reaching the filesystem. No payload executed and no lateral movement is possible from this event.

### <span style="color:red">Containment</span>

#### <span class="hl">Is the attacker still active?</span>

No outbound connections to attacker infrastructure were observed. No further action needed beyond blocking the file hash and associated delivery domain at the email gateway.

#### <span class="hl">Is the endpoint still exposed?</span>

NicolasPRD (172.16.17.37) was not compromised. The file was blocked and quarantined by the endpoint security solution.

#### <span class="hl">Actions taken</span>

File hash f2d0c66b801244c059f636d08a474079 blocked at the endpoint. Delivery source reviewed for any related phishing emails to other users.
