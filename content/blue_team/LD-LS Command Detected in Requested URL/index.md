### <span style="color:red">Identification</span>

#### <span class="hl">Is the traffic coming from outside?</span>

The source IP `172.16.17.46` is an **internal** address. The destination `188.114.96.15` resolves to `letsdefend.io` - a legitimate external platform. Traffic direction is **Company Network to Internet**.

#### <span class="hl">Is the source malicious?</span>

The source is an internal host. The destination is a known legitimate platform.

#### <span class="hl">What type of attack was attempted?</span>

No attack was attempted. The alert triggered because the detection rule matched the string `ls` within the word `ski**ls**` in the search query `?s=skills`. This is a **false positive** caused by a substring match - the rule lacks context to distinguish the `ls` Linux command from the same character sequence appearing inside a legitimate word. The request is a standard blog search on `letsdefend.io`.

### <span style="color:red">Triage Decision</span>

**False Positive.** The URL `https://letsdefend.io/blog/?s=skills` is a legitimate search request from an internal user to an external platform. The string `ls` is a substring of `skills` and does not represent a command injection attempt. No malicious traffic was identified.

### <span class="hl">IOCs</span>

None.
